## what is firewall ?
A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization’s previously established security policies.
## How it works ?
The  question is how firewall works ? we know firewall protect our data from attackers . firewall shields your network because it acts as a 24/7 filter, scanning the data that attempts to enter your network and preventing anything that looks suspicious from getting through.


## why firewall are important ?
Firewalls are important because they have had a huge influence on modern security techniques and are still widely used. Firewalls are used in both corporate and consumer settings. Modern organizations incorporate them into a security information and event management (SIEM) strategy along with other cybersecurity devices.In a single home network, a firewall can filter traffic and alert the user to intrusions. They are especially useful for always-on connections, like Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or cable modem, because those connection types use static IP addresses.
## Types of firewall 
If we categorizing firewall.like what they protect then there are two types of firewall.
(1.) network-based and (2.) host-based. 

(1.) Network-based :-Network-based firewalls guard entire networks and are often hardware.

(2.) Host-based :-Host-based firewalls guard individual devices – known as hosts – and are often software.

## When we categorizing by filtering method, the main types are:

• Packet-filtering firewalls

• Stateful inspection firewalls

• Application layer and proxy firewalls

• Next generation firewalls (NGFW)

## Advantage of firewall
• Stops Virus Attacks.

• Prevents Hacking.

 • Stops Spyware. 

• Promotes Privacy.

## Drawback of firewall
• User Restriction.

• Malware Attacks

• Complex Operations

• Performance

• Cost
